I'm Kenny from Los Angeles! I am a rising senior whose internship was cancelled due to Covid 19. So I decided that this summer I would prepare for new grad positions and work on side projects!  I am open to all help and advice if anyone has any!!!!  Personally, to not waste this summer I have started to learn Web Devlelopment, specifically picking up React, Node, and Express!
